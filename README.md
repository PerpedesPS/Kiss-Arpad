## Junior Data Scientist
### Throughout my bootcamp, I have gained hands-on experience in all of these areas. I have worked on projects that involved collecting and cleaning large datasets, analysing data to identify trends and patterns, and using machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. I have also learned how to use **Python** and various data science libraries such as _Pandas_, _NumPy_, and _SciPy_ to manipulate and visualise data. 

### Furthermore, my bootcamp experience has taught me the importance of teamwork and communication. In the bootcamp, we frequently worked in groups to complete projects and solve problems. This experience has honed my collaboration and communication skills, which will be essential in working with other teams within the company. Additionally, the bootcamp provided guest lectures from experts in the field, which gave me exposure to a range of perspectives and approaches to data science. 

### Overall, my experience in the data science bootcamp has equipped me with the technical skills and soft skills necessary for the data scientist role. I am confident that I can leverage my learnings to contribute to the company's goals and drive business success.
